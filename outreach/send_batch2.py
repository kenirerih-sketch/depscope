We're fans of what you're doing with supply chain security. We recently completed a health analysis of 14,700+ packages across 19 ecosystems (npm, PyPI, Cargo, Go, Maven, NuGet, RubyGems and 10 more), and thought the findings might interest you:

- 35% of packages score below 60/100 on our health index
- Deprecated packages like request (16M/week) and pkg-dir (80M/week) persist in dependency trees
- mlflow carries 18 known CVEs, gradio 11 — AI/ML tooling has the worst security profile
- Python ecosystem averages 61.5/100, significantly behind Cargo (74.5) and npm (70)

Full report: {REPORT}

The data comes from DepScope ({SITE}), an open API that scores packages on maintenance, security (OSV), popularity, maturity, and community. We built it specifically for AI coding agents to check before suggesting installs.

We'd love to hear your take on the findings, especially the deprecated-but-still-downloaded pattern.

Best,

Given your annual State of Open Source Security report, we thought you'd be interested in our findings from analyzing 14,700+ packages:

- gradio: 11 active CVEs

Meanwhile, foundational packages go unmaintained: ms (412M downloads/week, no update in 1+ year), annotated-types (160M/week, health 36/100).
