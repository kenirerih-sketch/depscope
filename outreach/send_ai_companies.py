        "body": f"""Hi Anthropic MCP team,

We built DepScope, a free package health API designed specifically for AI coding agents.

The problem: Claude Code (and other agents) suggest packages from training data without knowing if they're deprecated, vulnerable, or unmaintained. We analyzed 14,700+ packages and found 35% score below 60/100 on our health index.

What we built:
- Free API: {SITE}/api/check/npm/express (no auth, 200 req/min)
- MCP server: {NPM} (npx depscope-mcp)
- 10 endpoints: check, latest, exists, search, alternatives, compare, scan, vulns, health, now
- ChatGPT GPT already live in GPT Store

The API is designed for the exact use case MCP was built for: giving agents access to real-time data they can't get from training.

Data highlights from our report ({REPORT}):
- request (deprecated since 2020): still 16M downloads/week
- mlflow: 18 active CVEs
- ms: 412M downloads/week, no update in 1+ year
- PyPI avg health 61.5 vs Cargo 74.5

We'd love for DepScope to be considered for the MCP server registry or as a recommended tool for Claude Code users.

Happy to discuss integration, custom endpoints, or anything that helps agents make better package decisions.

Best,

Quick intro: we built DepScope ({SITE}), a free API that checks package health for npm, PyPI, and Cargo. It's designed for AI coding agents.

Why it matters: AI agents suggest deprecated and vulnerable packages because they rely on training data. DepScope provides real-time verification — health score, vulnerabilities, versions, alternatives.

We already have an MCP server on npm ({NPM}) and a ChatGPT GPT in the GPT Store.

Would love to explore how DepScope could be useful for Claude Code users, either as a recommended MCP server or as a built-in capability.

We built DepScope, a free package health API designed for AI coding agents. We already have a GPT in the GPT Store ("DepScope") that calls our API to verify packages before suggesting installs.

The problem it solves: coding agents suggest deprecated, vulnerable, or unmaintained packages from training data. DepScope provides real-time data — health scores, CVEs, version info, alternatives.

Stats from our analysis of 14,700+ packages:
- 35% score below 60/100 health
- Deprecated packages like request still get 16M downloads/week
- AI/ML packages (mlflow, gradio) have the worst security profile

Would love to discuss deeper integration with Codex, ChatGPT, or the GPT Store.

We built DepScope — a free API + MCP server that checks package health before installation. It's specifically designed for AI coding agents like Cursor.

How it helps Cursor users:
- Agent checks if a package is safe before suggesting `npm install X`
- Verifies the version is correct (not hallucinated)
- Warns about deprecated packages
- Suggests alternatives when needed

MCP server: npx depscope-mcp (on npm: {NPM})
API: {SITE}/api/check/npm/express (no auth)
10 endpoints: check, latest, exists, search, alternatives, compare, scan, vulns, health, now

Our data ({REPORT}): 35% of 14,700+ packages score below 60/100. AI agents compound the problem.

Would love DepScope to be a recommended MCP server for Cursor, or integrated as a default tool.
