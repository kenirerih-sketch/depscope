          DepScope is designed to expose public package metadata. We do not
          ingest customer source code, secrets, or production data. This keeps
          our attack surface narrow and our blast radius predictable.

            Cloudflare in front of all public endpoints: TLS termination, WAF,
            DDoS mitigation, bot scoring.
